    <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
  <ul>
    <li>2 free-range eggs</li>
    <li>100g/3.5oz caster sugar</li>
    <li>100g.3.5oz plain flour, extra for dusting</li>
    <li>1 lemon, juice and zest</li>
    <li>0.75 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>100g/3.5oz butter, melted and cooled slightly, plus extra for greasing</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Steps</h3>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Brush the madeleine tray with melted butter then shake in a little flour to coat, tapping out the excess.</li>
    <li>Whisk together the eggs and the sugar in a bowl until frothy. Lightly whisk in the remaining ingredients. Leave to stand for 20 minutes before carefully pouring into the prepared madeleine tray.</li>
    <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the mixture has risen a little in the middle and is fully cooked through. Transfer the madeleines to a wire rack and leave for a few minutes to cool slightly. These are best eaten within an hour of cooking.</li>
