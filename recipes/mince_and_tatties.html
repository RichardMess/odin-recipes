    <h2>Traditional Scottish winter warmer</h2>
    <p>Straight from Granny's kitchen into your cold, empty tummy this dish of tender minced beef and creamy mashed potatoes will have you coming back for seconds.<p/>  </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 stick of celery, diced</li>
        <li>500g beef mince (we used 12% fat mince)</li>
        <li>1.2kg potatoes</li>
        <li>4 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>450ml beef stock</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>50g butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large, deep frying pan or casserole. Add the onion, carrot and celery and cook for 5 minutes over a medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften. Add the mince and brown over a high heat for 5 minutes, stirring to break up the meat.
        </li>
        <li>Peel and roughly chop the potatoes. Cook in boiling, salted water for 15 minutes or until tender.</li>
        <li>Mix the flour into the mince mixture, then gradually add the stock, stirring to combine well. Bring to a simmer and add the Worcestershire sauce and season to taste. Simmer uncovered for 15 minutes.</li>
